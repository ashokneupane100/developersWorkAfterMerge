Related Properties Logic
Implement a system to recommend related properties based on the following criteria:
Price Range: Match properties within a similar or closest price range.
Rental Property Types: Categorize rentals as single room, double rooms, 1BHK (Bedroom, Hall, Kitchen), 2BK (Two Bedrooms, Kitchen), 2BHK (Two Bedrooms, Hall, Kitchen), larger flats, or entire houses.
Location: For SMS notifications, prioritize properties in the specified address or nearby areas using Google Geocoder or alternative geocoding services for accurate geolocation.

#
For selling properties (houses, land, or shops), match based on similar price ranges and area sizes, and send SMS notifications to relevant applicants as we have done in Renting.

# once a person does property request form, send SMS by Sparrow SMS, related properties and related nearby address. That's it for now.
